          I grew up in the United States, raised in Maryland, and after
          university, I moved to New York City for 6 years. Last year I quit my
          9-5 job as a frontend engineer to travel the world and cure my
          restlessness,but I ended up falling in love with Bali, and stayed
          there for 8 out of the 11 months of my trip. I fell in love with
          surfing there as well as being a 6 minute walk from the ocean. My
          parents originally emigrated from Taiwan, and that is where I got my
          love of food from, and then my love of photography from my father. I
          used to secretly save up to buy cameras and then hide them from my
          parents because I didn’t want them to find out - that I do have a gear
          obsession. Photography has always been part of my life whether it’s
          the childhood years of sleepover selfies and photoshoots, to now
          traveling and documenting moments and landscapes.
